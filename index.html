                    My name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Sanchez">Rick Sanchez</a>  from Earth (Dimension C-137) the widowed father of Beth Smith, and the grandfather 
                    of Morty and Summer Smith. After the death of my daughter Beth and apparent death of my wife Diane in my home, 
                    I developed a portal gun and spent the following decades travelling the infinite multiverse in search of the specific alternate version 
                    of myself whom I believe is responsible for killing them, befriending Birdperson and becoming a 
                    leading figure in the revolution against the Galactic Federation throughout my mid-30s.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    After being rejected romantically by Birdperson, I return to my journey of vengeance, embarking on a series 
                    of meaningless relationships before ultimately becoming the leader of a fledgling "Citadel of Ricks", 
                    originally formed to oppose me after I had killed a number of myself on his journey of vengeance, 
                    after abandoning said journey and binding the Ricks of the multiverse into a "Central Finite Curve" 
                    in which we are all the "Smartest Man in the Universe", manipulating the flow of realities in-which 
                    my daughter lived to ensure that she meet Jerry Smith and produce an endless number of hypothetical 
                    grandchildren, allowing them to hide from the Federation using their brainwaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my depressed stage, I abandons the Citadel and casts myself into the multiverse once again and crashes into the garage 
                    of a now-adult version of Beth from a reality where she was not killed and her version of me had 
                    abandoned her twenty years ago. I befriending her and my hypothetical grandchildren 
                    and frequently traveling on adventures through space, visiting other planets and dimensions with 
                    them, but most commonly Morty Smith.

                <ul>
                    <li><dfn>Assault:</dfn> In the episode A Rickle in Time, Rick started beating up a member of the Galactic Federation. 
                        Also in the pilot episode, Rick slaps a bystander alien in the face while fleeing from airport security, 
                        causing the alien to cry.
                    </li>
                    <li><dfn> Bioterrorism:</dfn> In the episode Rick Potion #9, Rick made a dysfunctional love potion that spread a flu-like 
                        virus to everyone in the world, which he tried to fix by making another virus including praying mantis DNA 
                        that caused them to rip apart and mutate into giant praying mantis monsters. He attempted to fix this, 
                        by using another potion, but this only made them mutate again, cronenberging the entire world. He couldn't fix 
                        the mutations in the end, and just left the dimension with Morty, leaving all of the mutated humans behind.
                    </li>
                    <li><dfn>Breaking and Entering (Burglary):</dfn> In the episode Lawnmower Dog, Rick and Morty snuck into Mr. Goldenfold's 
                        house while he was sleeping with the intent to brainwash him into giving Morty an A in math by invading Mr. 
                        Goldenfold's his dreams and incepting the idea.</li>
                    <li><dfn>Cable Piracy:</dfn> In the episodes Rixty Minutes and Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate, Rick used an interdimensional 
                        cable box to stream an infinite amount of TV channels to his own television and the intergalactic hospital television.
                    </li>
                    <li><dfn>Time Manipulation:</dfn> In the episode A Rickle in Time, Rick froze time for the equivalent of six months which caused time 
                        to start splitting and dividing multiple times, to the point where a Fourth Dimensional Being from the Galactic 
                        Federation came and tried to arrest him and his grandkids, also revealing that Rick may have done this before.
